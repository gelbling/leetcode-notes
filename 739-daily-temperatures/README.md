# monotonic stack

- always in decreasing order
- (temp, index)

## add initial temp to stack

## if next temp is GREATER than top of stack

- pop ALL smaller from stack, calculate their days, update output
- add new greater temp to stack

## if next temp SMALLER add to stack

## remaining temps in stack are 0
