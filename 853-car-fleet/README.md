### create array ff [(position[i], speed[i])....]

### sort array from greates position to smallest

### loop through sorted array

### calculate individual time to destination --> (target - position[i]) / speed[i]

### compare to top of stack

### IF time to destination <= top of stack

- don't do anything, since they become a fleet

### ELSE

- append new fleet to stack
